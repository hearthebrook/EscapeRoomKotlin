# Escape Room Design

This project is the design set up to build a virtual escape room! It has different objects to create a room with furnishings along with clues hidden around the furnishings. The game is set up to allow the user to search the room for clues and then use them on the locks to escape!

# Development Environment

I built this project to learn the basics of Kotlin in IntelliJ IDEA. I used the basic Kotlin materials from the download to get everything running. I also used a JDK to run my Kotlin project.
